						Introduction to Dynamic Programming :

It is a technoque in which a complex problem is solved by--
1. Breaking it into smaller sub-problems.
2. Solving those sub-problems and simply storing their results.
3. Re-use those stored results if sub-problems occurs/overlaps again. (Avoid solving sub-problem again)
4. Finally using solutions to smaller problems build up solution to complex problem.

Recursion and Dynamic Programming
1. It is mainly an optimization over recursion.
2. Dynamic Programming = Recursion + Memorization

Example - Fibonacci Series
It is a series of numbers in which first two numbers are 0 and 1. After that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21.......
			
		fib(0) = 0
		fib(1) = 1
		fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

Code for Fibonacci Series

public int fib(int n)
{
if(n==0) return 0;
if(n==1) return 1;
int left = fib(n-1);
int right = fib(n-2);
return left + right;
}


Optimal Substructure
A given problem has Optimal Substructure Property if optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using the optimal solution of its sub-problems.
Example - fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

Overlapping Subproblems
A given problem has Overlapping Subproblems property if solution of the given problem is obtained by solving same subproblems multiple times.
